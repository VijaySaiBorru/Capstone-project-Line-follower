# Capstone-project-Line-follower
INTRODUCTION

 Line Following is one of the most important aspects 
of robotics. A Line Following Robot is an autonomous robot which is able to 
follow either a black line that is drawn on the surface consisting of a contrasting 
color. It is designed to move automatically and follow the line. The robot uses 
arrays of optical sensors to identify the line, thus assisting the robot to stay on the 
track. The array of two sensor makes its movement precise and flexible. The robot 
is driven by DC gear motors to control the movement of the wheels. The Arduino 
Uno interface is used to perform and implement algorithms to control the speed of 
the motors, steering the robot to travel along the line smoothly. The ultrasonic 
sensor present in the robot detects any type of obstacle in front of the robot so that 
there is no accident happening with the robot. This project aims to implement the 
algorithm and control the movement of the robot by proper tuning of the control 
parameters and thus achieve better performance. It can be used industrial 
automated equipment carriers, small household applications, tour guides in 
museums and other similar applications, etc

MOTIVATION 

 We went through many topics when we were given 
this project. But the line follower fascinated us the most as there are many practical 
applications for this project. Ever thought of a robot which follows line? A perfect 
or near perfect mimic of nature? After all, the purpose of robotics is to recreate in
terms of machines what one see around to solve a problem or fulfil a requirement .
Developing a line follower robot involves overcoming challenges and solving 
problems related to sensor calibration, line detection algorithms etc. We thought 
that this alone won’t challenging enough for us. So, we decided to add obstacle 
avoidance part in this robot.
Our fascination towards robotics and desperation to learn more about building and 
programming robots is also one of the reasons for choosing this topic.
The areas that will be benefitted from the project:

 Industrial automated equipment carriers

 Entertainment and small household applications

 Tour guides in museums and other similar application
