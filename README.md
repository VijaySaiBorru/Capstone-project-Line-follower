INTRODUCTION
 Line Following is one of the most important aspects 
of robotics. A Line Following Robot is an autonomous robot which is able to 
follow either a black line that is drawn on the surface consisting of a contrasting 
color. It is designed to move automatically and follow the line. The robot uses 
arrays of optical sensors to identify the line, thus assisting the robot to stay on the 
track. The array of two sensor makes its movement precise and flexible. The robot 
is driven by DC gear motors to control the movement of the wheels. The Arduino 
Uno interface is used to perform and implement algorithms to control the speed of 
the motors, steering the robot to travel along the line smoothly. The ultrasonic 
sensor present in the robot detects any type of obstacle in front of the robot so that 
there is no accident happening with the robot. This project aims to implement the 
algorithm and control the movement of the robot by proper tuning of the control 
parameters and thus achieve better performance. It can be used industrial 
automated equipment carriers, small household applications, tour guides in 
museums and other similar applications, etc
